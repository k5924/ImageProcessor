# ImageProcessor

## Introduction

> An application made to perform processing operations on images as part of the CSI_5_OOP_2021 (Object Oriented Programming) module at LSBU (London South Bank University). The majority of the code was provided by the module leader where I have been tasked to:
<ul>
<li> Move each operation to an individual class </li>
<li> Create a common interface or abstract class that all individual operation classes descend from </li>
<li> Automatically add all operations to the operations menu in the application </li>
<li> Link the menu operations to code that executes the operation </li>
<li> Use a factory class to instantiate each operation </li>
<li> Pass a factory class instance to the ImageProcessor constructor to populate the menu items under operations </li>
</ul>

## Extended task

> Implement the following operations with their interfaces then add them to the factory so that a user can set them in the application
<ul>
<li>Negative: inverts the colours in the image</li>
<li>Threshold: converts an image to strict black and white only when provided with a threshold value</li>
<li>Blend: blend two images together mixing them with an alpha value</li>
</ul>
